# Base_Camp_Task-1


Concept--> Creators upload a video and set a micro fee (e.g., 0.001 ETH) to watch it. Think “OnlyFans meets YouTube,” but open and permissionless. Monetization: You take 6% fee on each unlock Optional “channel subscription” model (monthly Base subscription) Why It Works: Turns content into microtransactions Easy to build: paywall + IPFS link Works for educational creators or NSFW-lite categories
